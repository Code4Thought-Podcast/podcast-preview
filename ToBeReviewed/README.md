# What is this folder for?
This folder holds pre-listen audio files in MP3 file format. The access to these files is public and unrestricted.

The purpose is to allow participants in a podcast episode to listen to the edited version prior to publication. 
Once the episode is published, the corresponding MP3 file in this folder will be deleted. 

# When will previews be available?
I aim to make a preview available up to 5 days before publication date. 

However, depending on time pressure and workload I cannot guarantee a preview under all circumstances.
